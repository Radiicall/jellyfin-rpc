### It won't connect to discord!
If you are on Windows then open CMD or PowerShell and run it like this `./jellyfin.exe`, remember to have your `config.json` in the correct directory.

### Images aren't working?
Your server needs to be port forwarded for images to work without using the imgur api, if you enable imgur then they will work.

### It looks broken (Windows)
Open in PowerShell instead
